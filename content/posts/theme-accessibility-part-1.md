After being sidetracked on playing with Go's image package (which turns out to be a good thing, now I have some more content to audit), I'm back at tackling some of the accessibility issues with the current Bilberry theme. I am tempted to give the blog a few personal touches but I'll start with the priority.  
The current theme I'm using is [Bilberry-hugo-theme](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme). I ran a quick Accessibility Test with [WAVE Accessibility Checker](https://wave.webaim.org/)(WAVE comes as a convenient browser extension for Chrome and Firefox.).

## WAVE Results

After the audit, we received 9 errors and 26 color contrast errors. I'll start with the color contrasts errors first.

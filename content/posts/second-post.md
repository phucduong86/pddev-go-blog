#### Aka the real first post

After much delay for many reasons (lack of experience, material, imposter syndrome, etc...). I finally decided to launch my personal blog. I'm hoping to have this space to share my knowledge, experience and also be a playground for myself. 
This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - an open-source static site generator written in Golang language.  
  
Pros are plenty for me:  

1. Written in my favorite programming language.  
2. Simple setup. - [Official documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) is your best friend.    
3. Fast - how fast you asked? [35 times faster than the famous Jekyll.](https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-benchmark/)  
4. Extensive list of features: Sitemap Generation, RSS Feed, Analytics builtin, Multilingual ready...

The blog is using [Bilberry-hugo-theme](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme). In the next few weeks I'll be working on improving accessibility on the theme and document it here!
